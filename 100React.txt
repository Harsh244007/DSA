        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
      <p>Input value: {inputValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
}


18. What are uncontrolled components in React.js?
-> Controlled components in React.js are components that manage their own state and update it based on user input. The component's state becomes the source of truth for the input's value.

function UncontrolledComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const inputValue = inputRef.current.value;
    console.log('Input value:', inputValue);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}


20. Explain the concept of event handling in React.js.

48. What is the purpose of the "reducer" in Redux?
->The "reducer" in Redux is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as input and returns the new state. It defines how the state should be updated in response to different actions.

49. What are Redux actions and action creators?
-> Redux actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent events or updates in your application. Action creators are functions that create and return these action objects.

50. What is the purpose of the "dispatch" function in Redux?
-> The "dispatch" function in Redux is used to send actions to the Redux store. It triggers the state update process, where the reducer calculates the new state based on the current state and the dispatched action.

51. What is the purpose of the "connect" function in Redux?
-> The "connect" function in Redux is a higher-order function that connects a React component to the Redux store. It provides the component with access to the state and allows it to dispatch actions.

52. What are Redux middlewares and how do they work?
-> Redux middlewares are functions that intercept actions before they reach the reducer. They provide a way to customize or enhance the behavior of Redux, such as handling asynchronous actions or logging.

53. Explain the concept of React Context API.
-> React Context API is a feature in React.js that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without explicitly passing props at every level. It allows you to share state between components efficiently.

54. How does React Context differ from Redux?
