node js has everything event based

you can import events it's inbuit module from node js 
events.emitter will create a function which will be invoke when that line is executed
you can see it's generateor producing event in html we can have button
we can make through api when button will invoke api call and w can have event.emitter and that will invoke 
this event
we cna capture this with event.on


core modules are inbuild modeuls whcih comes out of box for example fs os events
file system console.log buffer

global and non global modules

global modules are module which we don't need to import like console and function

non global modules which are not globbaly defined we need to defined to use this fs

fs.writefilesync it will create new file in root directory
fs.unlinesync


path module it's useful to get path of root where we can manage path for fs module 
path.join is function (__direname ) it will give current directory path


if you give path.join second pargument as folder name then it will create that folder path 

which we can use to create new file
const dirpath = path.join(__dirname,"files")
fs.writefilesync(direpath+"hello.txt","this is new file)
