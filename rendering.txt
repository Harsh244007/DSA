we write something as component
take this component and translate in to real browser dom 
this process is called as dom

1. react first creates element form of react elemnts definition 
consider this as json object has mainly 4 key 
type 
props 
key 
ref

if we pass a children then it will props and inside of if children key with all the children elemnts and it will recuse to it until it's resolved

2. Construct the dom out of this object with it's reconcilation and diffing algorithms

3. What is Declarative rendering 
You define how the ui will look based on current state by defining ui elements
and react takes care of efficiently rendering updating the dom 

what is state in react it's internal data storage mechanish within a component it represent mutable data

4. Reconcilation algorithms it's set of rules that allows react which part of dom 

it's diffing algorithm it's compares virtual dom is kept in memory and browser dom is compared with it

Here's a simplified overview of the diffing process:

    React generates a new Virtual DOM tree based on the component's updated state or props.
    The diffing algorithm performs a top-down, depth-first traversal of the old and new Virtual DOM trees, comparing each node.
    React identifies four types of node changes: insertion (new node), deletion (removed node), update (changed node), or reordering (repositioned node).
    React applies the identified changes to the actual DOM using the minimum required operations. It updates, creates, or removes DOM nodes accordingly.
    React reconciles child components recursively, applying the diffing algorithm on their respective Virtual DOM trees.


    diffing algorithms rules.
