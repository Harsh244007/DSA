ejb and pojo

you can integrate with other hibernate 

 spring framework had lot of configuratyion which we needed to do 
 so they introduced spring boot whcih comes out of the box with lot fo configuration so we can focus more on concvertion
 coding part

 spring boot it gives production ready application

 startup project

 spring-boot-start-web
 
 spring-boot-start-jdbc java database connectivity
 to change configurationw e can use application.properties 

 dependency injection it's design pattern
buy laptop  

abstraction => we can take properties from a class object with new key 

tight coupling and loose coupling
losse coupling => we

dependency injection container => they will create new object and inject in class
 @component will generate dependecy from one class to another class
 @autowired will generate loose coupleg of speciifc object of class

MAVEN
GRADLE  this are dependecny management tool for java projects maven uses xmx base configutaion
pom.xml


spring auto wire

 we can create mock object for testing if it's loose coupling
